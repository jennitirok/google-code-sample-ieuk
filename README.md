# Hi! I'm Jennifer Gabriela Tirok
For this Google Coding Challenge, I chose to work using Python as it is my native programming language. I have fully implemented Part 1 of the 
challenge and have succesfully passed all the tests for this part. I have also attempted some of Part 2 and Part 3.

Thank you for the opportunity to be part of this Internship Experience!
